// One grain, one cell -- for these as much as for dust. They were drawn at a
// radius of a whole cell, which makes a mark two cells across, so two of them
// side by side overlapped and a column of them ran into each other. A mark is
// the size of the thing it stands for, and the thing it stands for is one grain.
// One glyph, one size, everywhere a grain is drawn outside the sand painter: in
// the air, on the ground, in the pile, on the cursor and in a worker's hands.
//
// Every one is drawn inside the same cell-sized box, centred on `x, y`. A cell
// is what a grain occupies and what it collides as, so a mark bigger than its
// cell is a mark that lies about where the thing is -- and marks of different
// sizes read as different amounts of something rather than different things.
// `glyph` draws the shape it stands for, which is what the counter and anything
// else with room to spare wants. Out in the yard there is no room to spare: a
// find is a solid cell of its own colour, exactly as the painter draws it in a
// pile, because that is the only thing that tiles.
//
// `g` is the canvas it goes on, and it is the frame's unless somebody says
// otherwise. The counter keeps its column of marks on a canvas of its own -- see
// `drawCount` -- and a mark that could only ever be drawn on the frame would
// have to be copied off it afterwards, which means reading the frame back.
