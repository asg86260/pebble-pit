// --- what a core gives off ----------------------------------------------------
// The one thing in this game with anything in it.
//
// Everything else in the yard is what it looks like: dust is dust, a shard is a
// blue chip, a rock is a lot of rock. A core is a rock's worth of *something*
// and the game has never said so -- it was a ring, drawn once, sitting there.
//
// So it gives something off: rings of cells walking outward and fading, each
// one a different colour and all of them cycling, which is as close to heat
// coming off a thing as a grid this coarse gets. Cells, not a gradient -- the
// glow is made of the same squares the rest of the world is, so it belongs to
// the picture rather than sitting on top of it -- and faint, because the whole
// of it should read as the air over the thing rather than as the thing.
const WAVES = 3;                   // rings in the air at once
const WAVE_MS = 2400;              // how long one takes to walk out and go
const WAVE_REACH = P * 6;          // and how far it gets
const WAVE_ALPHA = 0.62;

// Rounding that treats the two sides of nought alike. See the ring below.

export function drawCoreGlow(cx, cy, capAtGround) {

  // The middle, snapped once, and every cell of every ring measured from *it*.
  //
  // Each cell used to be snapped to the world grid on its own -- `round(x / P)`
  // of an absolute position -- which puts the ring where the grid happens to
  // fall rather than round the thing it belongs to. The core does not sit on a
  // whole cell (it rolls, and you carry it about), so the rounding bit harder on
  // one side than the other and the glow sat visibly off its own disc. Measured
  // out from a snapped middle, it is symmetrical by construction and still lands
  // on whole cells.
  // The origin IS the centre of the circle. Not a cell corner, not the nearest
  // cell centre -- the point the disc is drawn around.
  //
  // This has been wrong twice, in the same way both times: the ring was measured
  // out from a *snapped* version of the middle, so it sat wherever the lattice
  // fell rather than around the thing it belongs to. Snapping to a corner put it
  // half a cell down and right; snapping to a cell centre fixed the systematic
  // half-cell and left up to another half of drift, because a core does not sit
  // on a whole cell -- it rolls, and you carry it about. Three pixels on an
  // eighteen-pixel core is still visibly off its own disc.
  //
  // So nothing is snapped. Each cell is still a whole cell and still a whole
  // cell's step from the next -- the shape is as square as it ever was -- but
  // the point they are all measured from is `cx, cy` exactly, which makes the
  // ring symmetric about the disc by construction at any position.
