# Changelog

Every bug fixed, under the version it shipped in. A fix lands here in the same
commit that fixes it, under **Unreleased**; `npm run release` turns that
heading into the version number and the date, so nobody types a number by hand.

One line per fix, in the player's words: what was wrong, and what is true now.
Features go in DESIGN.md; this file is for things that were broken.

## Unreleased

## v0.1.5 — 2026-09-13

- Tabbing away from the page reset the game. A store with no tab name in it
  was being read as another tab's store; now it is the same game.

## v0.1.4 — 2026-09-13

- The crew list pushed the house board around when it opened. It pops over
  the board now, one card wide, with the door as its own row on top.
- Six house checks that a commit cut by accident are back.
- A grain going into the pit paid no dust. It has its own dust gain now.

## v0.1.3 — 2026-09-12

- A release with butler missing from PATH committed and tagged before it
  failed. The check runs first now, on a clean tree.

## v0.1.2 — 2026-09-12

- A reset left behind fields the save throws away. It puts down everything
  off the `SAVED` declaration now, so the two can not drift apart.
- A card's price showed a count on its way rather than its value.
- The tower's rows said something different from every other board's for a
  build in progress. They say "building" and "in line" like the rest, and a
  waiting row reads "queued up in n".
- An achievement landing was silent. It is said out loud now.
